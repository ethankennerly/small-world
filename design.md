Jennifer Russ played Agar.io about 1 or 2 minutes.

	What do I do?
	What am I supposed to do?
	Eat dots of my color?
	Oh, I'm a cell eating shit.
	Agh!  Don't eat me!
	How do I move?
	Arrow key?
	Direct?
	This is hard to control.

Top opportunities to motivate Jennifer to play 3 minutes:

- Tap to project in that direction, animating exhaust in opposite direction, with momentum.
- Start with a trail of dots and a finger tapping at the dot.
- Trails of dots to train maneuvering.
- Some smaller cells fleeing with fearful emoji facing their direction.
- Cells are same color.
- Cells are green or blue or pink if smaller.
- Cells are red or orange if bigger.
- Boundaries of movable space are marked.
- Angry emoji face on bigger cell that is approaching.

Other ideas to motivate Jennifer:

- Match with less skilled players or bots.
- Number on Jennifer indicating leaderboard rank.
- Mark leaderboard number on the cell, such as with a crown on the cell.
- Cells that change color of your own cell.
- Cells that decorate your cell with a pattern.
